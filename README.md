# chippy
A Chip-8 Interpreter/Emulator in C++; uses the Cinder Framework for creative coding (https://libcinder.org/) for graphics and audio.

This is in alpha stage of development (i.e core code implemented with some working programs and some completely broken programs)

TODO:
 - write tests and debug chip8 programs that don't currently work (e.g blinky)
 - implement audio
 - general code cleanup 

FUTURE:
 - debug mode with overlay graphics (halt execution, examine registers).
